This file is a Batch-coded Multitool. To be able to use the Multitool drag the file named "multitool access" on your desktop. Now drag the rest of the file on your desktop. It is very important that the "multitool Access" and the file Folder named "multitool-hacks" are NOT in a Folder together. The "multitool-hacks" Folder should now stay like this, so do not edit, delete, or add any files to it.

To start the Multitool you want to open the file named "multitool access". It will ask you for a Password. If you type in the wrong Password the file will close automatically. To Access the Multitool, put the code "080893" in. The Multitool should open now. The Multitool and all the files it is able to open, only work on a System that is able to run Batch-scripted files.

To use the Multitool and to to open one of the files you just look next to the file, where you can see a number. Press this number on your Keyboard (in older versions you had to hit enter after that but this is removed in this Version). The file should open now.

If you dont want to have a password-secured multitool, open the file named "multitool-hacks" and drag the file named "multitool" and the file folder named "files" out of it, and put both on your desktop. It is important that the "multittol"-file and the file folder are both on your desktop. If you want to have the multittol in a file folder, you can do it. Just make sure the folder named "files" is in the same one.
