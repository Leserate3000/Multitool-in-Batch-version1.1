This Programm will crash your PC or Laptop using a Batch file wich opens the Control Panel over and over again. Do not open it unless you want to crash your PC or Laptop.

This Programm only works on devices wich are able to run Batch-scripted files. If you accidentally opened it you can try to hold down ALT and F4. This will close the Control Panels one by one and might also stop the Programm, wich is starting the Control panels over and over again. This is NOT tested and might not work.
